# BattleShip
it is my old homework, console version of the game battleship.

The rules are the same as in the regular Battleship game Before starting the game, you can select 2 points for placing ships random or manual.

The game also has settings for changing symbols/colors/table sizes.

The bot does not play at random, but at half, that is, until it destroys the first part of the ship, after which it searches in neighboring cells to destroy the ship
